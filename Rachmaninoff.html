            <p class="text-right">“Music is enough for a lifetime, but a lifetime is not enough for music.”
              <br>Sergei Rachmaninoff</p>
            <p class="bottom_margin">Rachmaninoff’s personal reserve was complemented by a deeply
             generous nature, which is reflected in the disciplined opulence of
            his music. Although his critical status fell somewhat during the post-War
             dominance of modernism, the affection in which his music was held by audiences
             never wavered, and now the critics are realising that the public was right all along:
              Rachmaninoff’s music often attains greatness – there is individuality in its harmonic richness,
               orchestral colouration and melodic warmth which will guarantee it a permanent and much-loved
               place in the repertoire.</p>
                <li> <b>1873</b> Born in Oneg, near Novgorod (Russia)</li>
                <li> <b>1888</b> Began to study piano with Siloti and composition with Arensky</li>
                <li><b>1891</b> Composed what was to become his best-known work, <em> the Prelude in C sharp minor</em></li>
                <li><b>1897</b> Disasterous premiere of his First Symphony, after which he destroyed the score</li>
                <li><b>1900</b> Began his Second Piano Concerto, one of the most frequently performed of all works</li>
                <li><b>1904</b> Took up a conductor’s post at the Bolshoi Opera in Moscow</li>
                <li><b>1917</b> Determined that he and his family would have to leave the country, and he accepted an invitation to perform in Stockholm. The composer, his wife and their two daughters left in December; he was never to return.
                <li><b>1918</b> Moved to America. There, his concertising increased, reducing his time for composition; he also began a career in the studio, producing recordings that eighty-odd years later are still regarded as some of the most valuable interpretations, of his own and others’ music, ever committed to disc. </li>
                <li><b>1940</b> Composed his last large-scale masterpiece <em>the Symphonic Dances</em>.
                <li><b>1943</b> At the time of his last recital, on 17 February, in Knoxville, Tennessee, he was already gravely ill, and he died on 28 March, in Beverley Hills. </li>
